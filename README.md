# Efficient Pediatric Heart Transplant Predictions

## Overview

It is a research-driven project aimed at improving 1-year mortality prediction for pediatric heart transplant patients using machine learning and synthetic data augmentation techniques. By enhancing the accuracy of risk predictions, the project contributes to better donor-recipient matching and improved survival outcomes in children undergoing heart transplants.

## Key Features

- **Focus Area**: 1-year post-transplant mortality prediction in pediatric heart transplant recipients.
- **Dataset**: Pediatric heart transplant data from the UNOS (United Network for Organ Sharing) database.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Machine Learning (KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
  - Ensemble Learning (Voting Classifier with Boosted Decision Trees and Extra Trees)
  - Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
  - Synthetic Data Generation for artificial recipient-donor matching

## Highlights

- Developed a Self-Supervised Learning KNN (SSL-KNN) model with **99% accuracy**
- Achieved **100% accuracy** with a robust ensemble Voting Classifier
- Demonstrated the value of data augmentation in limited medical datasets
